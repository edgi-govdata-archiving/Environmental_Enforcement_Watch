## How to use this repo
We are using a Github Project attached to this repo to manage tasks associated with organizing the EEW events. You can find the Project board [here](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/EEW_Planning/projects/1) (or look for the Projects tab at the top of this repo.)

### To make a task in the project board:
1. Go to the Project board
1. In the To Do column, click the + icon: ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/454690/79391336-38ffe280-7f26-11ea-8913-42f905098fd4.png)
1. Write a note, save, then click on the three dots in the upper right corner of the note and click "Convert to issue" ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/454690/79391335-38674c00-7f26-11ea-97ec-1b94606935b9.png)
1. Now you can drag it around on the project boards, or access it in more depth in the [Issues](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/EEW_Planning/issues) tab of this repo. If you close the issue, it will automatically move the card to the "Done" column.

### Using Github Issues
* An issue is something **specific** and **resolvable**, like a task or a question
* Github Issues can be accessed from the [Issues](https://github.com/edgi-govdata-archiving/EEW_Planning/issues) tab
* Usually, the first message in the Issue says what needs resolving and provides any supporting information. Anyone can then comment on the issue to add to the conversation
* Github issues are typically public but not formal—somewhere between an email and a chat message. It is ok to jump in to a conversation in a Github issue if you have something to add
* If you are working on an issue, it is good form to comment and say so, and to provide updates (as comments), especially if you are blocked, have a question, or don't have time to work on it anymore
* By default, anyone who has contributed to or been tagged with their Github handle in that issue will receive notifications about updates to that issue. You can see your notifications by clicking on the bell icon in the top right of any Github page (if you're signed in), so this is a good way to stay engaged with a conversation

### To make an issue into a project task:
*This is for if you make a Github issue first, then want it to show up in the Project board.*

1. Make a Github issue
1. In the Project board, Click on "+ Add cards" near the top right of the screen ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/454690/79391908-436eac00-7f27-11ea-97b7-84df31d2c60a.png)
1. Find your issue in the menu that pops out and click on it
